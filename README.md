## i18n effort
Should you be interested in translating Libmol.org to your language, your contribution is most welcome!  
First part of the translation process deals with the user interface. It requires completing an [online Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfpNe1SwHQ51arbPlnE6y7rDB-JKImhGICQGsMzQtes/edit?usp=sharing) with your locale keywords.  
The second part of the process is more involving and requires forking this repository, duplicating one of the folders in locales/ and translating all the markdown files in it.  
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

## Developpement and Build Setup
You don't need this to use LibMol.org  
The source code is distributed from this repository and can be downloaded to your computer using Git or the complete archive.  
Once the source code is downloaded and extracted, you'll have to install all dependencies required to build the project.  

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

ToDo
- Files : 
  - handle mega files (display surfaces)
- Errors/warnings : send messages
  - when file could not be uploaded
  - when network is not available --> online/offline api
- Commandes : 
  - add/remove labels
  - create/remove surface, export as STL objects for printing (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/exporters/STLBinaryExporter.js)
  - provide choices for hetero (e.g. : in cox2 asp and hem)
- Sequences : 
  - interactions ? <http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/news.do?year=2016&article=57e30fd490f5613003407f09&feature=true>
  - select from distance (within)
- 3D View:
  - change cursor when rotating, zooming, panning, selecting
- code refactor
  - event bus : https://devblog.digimondo.io/building-a-simple-eventbus-in-vue-js-64b70fb90834#.706mbapkg
- bugs :
  - firefox : not going fullscreen
  - no settings in fullscreen mode
  - color palette button should react to the state
  - polymer size should exceed 3 for ribbon/backbone
