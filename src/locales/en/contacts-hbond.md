# Hydrogen bonds
Electronegative atoms (such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) covalently bound to a hydrogen atom tend to attract electrons towards them, at the expense of the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom then gets a positive partial charge, while the "donor" atom gains a negative partial charge. The hydrogen atom may therefore be attracted to another electronegative atom (named "acceptor" atom) and form a hydrogen bond.

The hydrogen bond energy is low (&#8776 30kJ/mol, compared to 400kJ/mol for a covalent bond) and it engages atoms separated by short distances (0.2nm in water for example).

The Libmol software (based on the NGL library) distinguishes 4 categories of hydrogen bonds:
* **Backbone H bond**: these are the bonds between the nitrogen and the oxygen from the backbone of the neighboring amino acids in a polypeptidic chain. These are responsible for secondary structures ([helices](lexicon-helice) and [strands](lexicon-feuillet))
* **Water H bonds**: these hydrogen bonds are sometimes involved in the active sites of certain enzymes (such as hydrolases)
* **Weak H bonds**: these hydrogen bonds involve weakly electronegative atoms (such as carbon)
* **Other H bonds**: these bonds explain most of the interactions between different molecules or between the different structures of a protein.
