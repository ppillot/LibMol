# Salt bridge
In an aqueous phase, depending on the pH, some amino acids may bear a positive or a negative charge. For example, amino acids with an acidic side chain such as glutamate or aspartate have a negative charge at pH7. [Nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) also bear negative charges on their phosphate group at this pH.

Two molecules having opposite charges exert a mutual attraction. If they are close enough, they can make an ionic bond also called salt bridge.
