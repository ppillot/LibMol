# Non covalent interactions
This tab is where you can control and get informations about non covalent interactions:
* [Hydrogen bonds](contacts-hbond)
* [Salt bridges](contacts-saltbridge)
* [Metal coordination](contacts-metal)
* [Hydrophobic interactions](contacts-hydrophobic)
* [π-stacking and cation-π interactions](contacts-pi)

## Definitions
A **covalent interaction** bonds two atoms from the same molecule by sharing an **electron** duet. Non covalent interactions may occur between atoms of the same chain, between different chains from the same molecule or between two different molecules (such as a protein and a ligand). The corresponding binding energy of a single non covalent interaction is generally weaker than the one of a covalent bond. These interactions are critical to many biological processes such as contact between molecules, spatial conformation, biochemical reactions.

## Guide
To display interactions with a specific residue or a specific chain, you can right-click on this object from the 3D model or the **Sequence tab**. In the context-menu pick the **Interactions** option.
