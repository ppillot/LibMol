# Helices
Helices are among the main patterns taken by [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid) chains in a [protein](lexicon-protein) (also known as secondary structures).  
In a helix, the amino acid chain is wound around an axis. The side chains of the amino acids point towards the outside of the helix axis. The amino acids in a helix establish hydrogen bonds, with the neighbouring amino acids of the next helical turn and of the previous one.
Depending on the **pitch** of the helix (number of amino acids per helical turn), different categories of helices are defined (helix α, helix 3-10, helix π having respectively 3.6, 3 and 5 amino acids per helical turn).
