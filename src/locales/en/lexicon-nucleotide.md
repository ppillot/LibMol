# Nucleotides
Nucleotides are the building blocks of [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) such as __DNA__ or __RNA__. 
A nucleotide is made of three parts:
* the __Nucleobase__, or __nitrogenous base__. They exist in 5 different main types (__Adenine__, __Guanine__, __Thymine__, __Cytosine__, __Uracile__) which can undergo chemical modifications (particularly in RNAs)
* the __Carbohydrate__ which can either be a __ribose__ (in RNA), or a __deoxyribose__ (in DNA)
* the __Phosphate__ group
