# Proteins
Proteins are large-scale and complex organic molecules made of at least one chain of [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid).
Amino acid composition (governed by cell's genetic information) is the main responsible for protein properties such as its shape and function.  
Proteins undertake different roles inside and outside of cells:
* Communication (peptidic messengers, receptors)
* Structure (as components of the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, the chromatin and chromosomes ...)
* Chemical reactions (enzymes)
* Defense and attack (peptidic toxins, antibodies, receptors of the immune system)
* Etc...
