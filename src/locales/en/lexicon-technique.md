# Techniques for determining the structure of molecules.

Molecules are inaccessible to direct observation by conventional techniques. Indirect techniques are used to devise models of these molecules.

## X-ray Crystallography
The molecule studied is purified and then placed under crystallization conditions so as to form an ordered stack. When an X-ray beam is aimed at this crystal, the electro-magnetic waves are diffracted and make interference figures on a detector (a set of spots). The locations of these spots depend on the electronic cloud of the molecule, which can be reconstituted by mathematical methods.  
The amino acids making the protein can then be fitted into this electronic cloud so as to build a complete model.  
This method is the most commonly used for molecular models determination. The resolution is usually too sparse for determining the positions of the hydrogen atoms.  which do not appear in the models. It may be noted that this is only a model and that during the determination, the molecules studied are conditions far removed from the biological conditions. On the other hand, some proteins do not crystallize and can not be determined by this technique.

## Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)
A solution of the sample to be analyzed is placed in a strong magnetic field. The atoms are subjected to radio waves. The analysis of the observed resonances is used to determine the neighboring atoms as well as the conformation of the bonded atoms. From these informations a set of restraints is obtained and used to find the different possible models in accordance. Thus, the NMR technique leads to a set of several possible models. It is suitable for small to medium molecules and has the advantage of being applied to molecules in solution, which is closer than crystals to in vivo conditions.

## 3D electron microscopy (3DEM)
This technique is currently in full expansion. The term covers a wide range of experimental procedures. For example, it may consist of imaging large-scale complexes at different viewing angles. Computerized image analysis methods are  applied to create a 3D structure from these datasets. Electron diffraction can be performed if the structure is sufficiently periodic or can be crystallized. When the resolution is low, this technique is combined with crystallography to fit the atomic structures coming from crystallography into the envelope obtained by 3DEM.
