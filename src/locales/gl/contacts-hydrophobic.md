# Hydrophobic interactions
In an hydrated environment, water molecules are organized in clusters behaving as cages around hydrophobic side chains. When two such hydrophobic side chains come close to each other, the water clusters merge resulting in a more stable association.

A survey of the molecular complexes between protein and ligands in the Protein Databank has revealed that hydrophobic interactions are the main type of non covalent interactions binding ligands to proteins.

Hydrophobic interactions are instrumental to certain functions. For example, they occur in the binding of ligands to hydrophobic pockets (heme in hemoglobin, steroid receptor ligand binding domain), they anchor membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer, they are part of the gating mechanism in ion channels.
