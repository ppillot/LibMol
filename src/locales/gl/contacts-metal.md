# Metal interactions
These interactions occur mostly between a metallic cation and metal binding partners named ligands. Bonds are defined as **dative** when they are made of an electron duet "taken" from the ligand (called the donor, the metal being the bond acceptor). Bonds types can also be **ionic** when the metal is a cation, interacting with anions.

The geometry of these interactions depends on the metal coordination number. For example in biological molecules, iron coordination number is 6 which makes it the center of an octahedron.
