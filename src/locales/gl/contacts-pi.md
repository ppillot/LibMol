# π-π and cation-π Interactions
Aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine) or nucleobases from nucleic acids may interact with neighboring aromatic ring bearing compounds (π-stacking) or with cations (cation-π interactions).  

Aromatic rings stacking between nucleotides from the same chain is one of the main interactions in nucleic acid structures. Binding of several small ligands with their respective receptor (for example between acetylcholine and the nicotinic receptors) relies on interactions between cations from the ligands and aromatic amino acids from the receptor.

These interactions originate from the spatial distribution of electronic densities around aromatic rings (due to π orbitals). For example, aromatic rings centers have a lower electronic density and can interact with higher electronic density harboring rings borders.
