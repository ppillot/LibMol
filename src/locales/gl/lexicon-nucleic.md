# Nucleic acids (DNA - RNA)
Nucleic acids are large-scale organic molecules whose main role is to store and transmit genetic information.  
They are made of a succession of building units: the [nucleotides](lexicon-nucleotide).  
Nucleic acids derive their name from the facts that they were identified first in the nucleus and that the nucleotides contain a **nucleobase** and a **phosphoric acid** part.  
DNA and RNA difference is based on the type of carbohydrate present in each nucleotide, respectively **deoxyribose** for DNA and **ribose** for RNA.  
Nucleotides bond with their neighbors on the same chain by a covalent bond between the phosphate group and the (deoxy) ribose group.  
Typically DNA contains two nucleotidic chains, maintained by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. RNA is often made of a single chain, which can be folded back on itself, thus forming secondary structures maintained by bonds between bases (loops, pins, etc.).  
In Libmol, one can distinguish between the two types of nucleic acids using [color by biochemical nature](color-bynature) coloring pattern. They can be selected distinctively with the DNA or RNA  keyword in the [selection command line](select-command-line).
