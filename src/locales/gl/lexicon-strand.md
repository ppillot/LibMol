# Beta strands
β-strands are among the main patterns taken by [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid) chains in a [protein](lexicon-protein) (also known as secondary structures).  
β-strands have a planar conformation. Amino acids side chains generally point perpendicularly to the strand's plane. Amino acids bind to neighbouring strands through hydrogen bonding. Adjoining β-strands may form larger scale structures such as barrels.
